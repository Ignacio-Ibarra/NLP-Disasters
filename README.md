# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets. 
This is an activity for the subject 7506 - Organizaci√≥n de Datos of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Buenos Aires. It is based on a Kaggle contest of Natural Language Processing. The goal is to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. In the first part of this work, we'll make an exploratory analysis over the training dataset. The training dataset has these following columns: 

 *`id` - a unique identifier for each tweet
 *`text` - the text of the tweet
 *`location` - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
 *`keyword` - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
 *`target` - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
